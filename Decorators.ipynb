      "So let's break down what we're doing with **timer** here. **timer** takes a function and creates a new function called **wrapper** which takes a variable number of positional arguments. Note that we could make wrapper take whatever we want. In this situation it would be perfectly acceptable to have it take just a single argument since we're only wrapping **summate** (and **summate** only takes a single argument).\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside of **wrapper** we get the current time value and then call the function that was passed into **timer**. You might be wondering how we can do that. The reason is called a *closure* and the concept is fairly straightforward. Every time **timer** is called its argument is set to some value. A new **wrapper** function is then created in an environment where *func* is set to the value that was passed into **timer**. In otherwords, the *func* variable in **wrapper** references a variable in an enclosing scope (that of **timer**). Because this reference exists, the variable *func*'s value remains valid even after **timer** finishes executing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continuing on, **wrapper** calls the enclosing function, prints some useful information, and then returns the result of the function's invocation. **timer** then finishes by returning the **wrapper** function instance that it just created.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is great, minus one problem. Having to manually make **summate_with_time** is annoying. We don't want to have to create an additional function every time we want to time its execution. It would be great if we could just *decorate* our summate function in some way that would tell Python to do the wrapping for us!"

However, it is important to note that a decorator doesn't have to be a function. It can be anything that is a *Callable*. In Python, a *Callable* is any object that can be, well, called! Let's look at another way of making a decorator, but this time we'll use a class."
